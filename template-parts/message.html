<!--
    Hello! Welcome to the NCS4 site! I hope you enjoy your stay
    and find my source code readable and interesting. I try to
    use descriptive, minimalist class and id names for easier
    debugging and styling, and avoid JavaScript as much as is
    reasonable to avoid stressing slower connections.

    I am currently housed in Mississippi, written and maintained
    in-house at the NCS4 and served from a local server at The
    University of Southern Mississippi (usm.edu). My developers
    have put a lot of work into me to make me look good and
    feel responsive on any device and be as accessible as possible
    for all kinds of people, so please enjoy! If you see anything
    which could use some improvement, please feel free to reach out
    (ncs4.usm.edu/about/contact)!

    To give you an idea of some of what goes into maintaining me,
    here's some of my specs:

      - I am a WordPress site! I run on a custom theme built on top
        of _s (Underscores; https://underscores.me) called ncs4-pro!
        This theme handles my entire look; without it, I'd be
        bare bones!

      - I use normalize.css (MIT; https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
        as a reset. That means that I look as close to the same as
        possible no matter what browser or operating system you view
        me on!

      - My developers use Sass (https://sass-lang.com/) in order to
        make their CSS more readable, maintainable and concise so
        they can focus on what's important: making me the best I
        can be so you have the best experience possible!

      - I use SVG graphics whenever possible for large images,
        PNG graphics for small icons which need transparency,
        and JPG graphics when size is the most important factor!

      - My developers always check for page responsiveness (that
        means how well the page scales with different screen sizes),
        keyboard-only navigation, accessibility preferences such as
        prefers-reduced-motion, and screen reader accessibility to
        ensure everyone is able to enjoy me as much as possible!

    Even with all this, my developers are only humans (many of them
    are even still students!), so I hope you can forgive small
    missteps or errors here and there. We all certainly try our
    best and love the work that we do! <3

    Happy exploring! I hope to see you again soon!
    - NCS4
